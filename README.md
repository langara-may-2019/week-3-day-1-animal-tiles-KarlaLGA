# Week 3 - Day 1 - Animal Tiles
I thought I would go in another direction and do something useless and fun for this one. Website will come tomorrow, but for now, let's do something silly.
We are going to be binding audio clips to images, and shifting them around. This is a good use of CSS grid, by the way, and where it comes into its own. 

## What we will be making:

### No slides today, just links in the instructions, if you get stuck. Also, I'm always on Slack.
### Have Fun, and Happy Coding!
